### Note

One thing! If you are going to develop make sure to change in the webpack/webpack.config.js file line 6 from ```'production'``` to ```'development'``` and in line 10 change ```'/Pokedex-Webpack/'``` simply to ```'/'```

Remember to install all dependencies with
```npm i && npm i -D```

To start the project in development
```npm run dev```

To bring it to production
```npm run build```
